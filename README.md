# üêç Python Sample Application for Tolling Vision

This repository provides a sample Python application demonstrating how to use [Tolling Vision](https://tollingvision.com) ‚Äî a Dockerized AI-powered service for tolling companies. Tolling Vision extracts key vehicle data from images or image sequences, including:

- **ANPR/ALPR** ‚Äì Automatic Number Plate Recognition  
- **MMR** ‚Äì Make and Model Recognition  
- **ADR** ‚Äì Dangerous Goods Sign Recognition

Tolling Vision is highly scalable and integrates seamlessly via **gRPC**. For integration guidance, see the [How to use Tolling Vision](https://tollingvision.com/how-to-use-tolling-vision/) tutorial.

This sample leverages the `analyze` function in the `TollingVisionService` to process multiple images of a vehicle ‚Äî such as **front**, **rear**, and **overview** shots ‚Äî and extract license plates and vehicle model information.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Tolling Vision Python Client** ‚Äî available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tollingvision-scsinfo/)
- **Tolling Vision service** ‚Äî running locally or remotely (see [Get Started](https://tollingvision.com/get-started))

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. üì¶ Install Dependencies

Use pip to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install grpcio-tools tollingvision-scsinfo
```

### 2. üßæ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartcloudsol/tollingvision-python-sample.git
cd tollingvision-python-sample
```

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Sample

Run the application with:

```bash

## üß© Parameter Descriptions

| Parameter         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `<ADDRESS>`       | Address of the Tolling Vision service in `ip:port` format. |
| `<SECURED>`       | `True` or `False` ‚Äî whether the communication uses SSL/TLS encryption. |
| `<THREAD_COUNT>`  | Number of parallel requests (up to the limit of your license). |
| `<IMAGE_FOLDER>`  | Path to the folder containing images to process. |
| `<RESULT_FILE>`   | File path for saving results (CSV format). |
| `<GROUP_PATTERN>` | Regular expression for grouping images (e.g., `"^.{7}"` ‚Äî by the first 7 characters). The first match group is used as the key. |
| `<FRONT_PATTERN>` | Regex for identifying front images (e.g., `".*front.*"`). |
| `<REAR_PATTERN>`  | Regex for identifying rear images (e.g., `".*rear.*"`). |
| `<OVERVIEW_PATTERN>` | Regex for identifying overview images (e.g., `".*scene.*"`). |

## üìö Example Usage

```bash
python3 tollingvision-sample.py 192.168.1.100:443 True 4 ./images ./results.csv "^.{7}" ".*front.*" ".*rear.*" ".*scene.*"
